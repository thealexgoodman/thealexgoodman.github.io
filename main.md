## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Alex Goodman. I'm a cybersecurity expert specializing in GRC (governance, risk, compliance). Throughout my career, I have helped many organizations comply with HIPAA, PCI-DSS, HITRUST, and NERC CIP 013-1 regulations and standards and enhanced their security posture. I have performed over 150 risk assessments in the healthcare and utilities sectors on applications, facilities, supply chain, and third parties. In my assessments, I not only identify security gaps, but also work with organizations on plans to remediate and fix those problems. I have worked with companies ranging from the biggest global organizations like Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft, all the way to small, single person operations.

I don't just do risk assessments, though. I have worn many hats in the information security field. I have created and improved enterprise policies and SOPs. I was the Security Awareness Leader at one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the southeastern United States, creating educational materials and training and educating doctors and nurses about the importance of good security practices. I was brought on board to help a major corporation clean up after a data breach. I've led teams of analysts in auditing parts of the Bulk Electric System like power plants, acted as the liaison between information security and legal teams, sat on change management boards, created business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and was even chosen to represent a major organization's "Blockchain Center of Excellence".

I love to write, which lends itself well towards writing reports and policy documents. I have a knack for explaining complex technical topics in simple ways, helping non-technical people (or even busy executives) understand the importance of cybersecurity practices and controls.

## Why do I do what I do? 

Most security practitioners would say it's about protecting the data or systems, which isn't necessarily the wrong mindset. Personally, though, I'm in this to help organizations to protect people. Whether I'm evaluating the default user accounts of a cutting-edge biomedical device, or diving deep into where a power plant's ICS components are sourced, I want to keep people safe.

## A little more about me:

I run a vCISO/advisor consulting service called TheGoodCISO. I work with clients to enhance their security postures, with a focus on compliance, risk management, security awareness training, and creation of policies.

I host weekly classes and mentoring sessions for newcomers beginning careers in cybersecurity.
I play CTF (capture the flag) challenges with a high performing team and I am in the top 6% worldwide on TryHackMe.

I am also interested in emerging technologies (blockchain, cloud, internet of things, artificial intelligence / machine learning).
